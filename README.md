# Hyena Project weather data

## Introduction 

This public repository allows access to the detailed weather data collected by the [Ngorongoro Hyena Project](https://hyena-project.com/) in Ngornogor Crater, Tanzania. The data have been collected to study the population of spotted hyena (*Crocuta crocuta*) in the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania but are made publicly available for any researchers or managers to use. The repository contains 4 sections:

- [Weather station network details](#network): A general overview of the weather station network established in Ngorongoro Crater, including station locations, data collection frequency and variables measured.

- [Recent report](#report): The most recent .pdf report summarising weather patterns and trends in Ngorongoro Crater since weather data collection began in September, 2021. This is intended as a high-level summary of weather patterns that may be used by managers and decision makers.

- [Summary data](#summarydata): Daily summary data from all stations within the weather data network.

- [Raw data](#rawdata): Full high-frequency weather dataset.
